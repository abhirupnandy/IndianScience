                    The Indian Science Reports portal is a repository of various quantitative indicators of Indian Scientific research
                    during the period 2010-19. While some indicators are taken as it is from the scholarly database Dimensions,
                    several others are computed by using standard Scientometric methods. Some values (such as x and x(g) index) are
                    computed by using network-based and text-based analytical methods. Relevant comparisons with other major countries
                    are also provided.

                <p class="text-justify">
                    The main objective of the portal is to provide a glance at indicators and values related to Indian research output,
                    both overall as well as from different institutions. The analysis presented shows indicators about research output,
                    citations, authorship, international collaboration, gender distribution, open access, research grants and social
                    media visibility etc. for the Indian research output during 2010-19. The portal also includes institutional reports
                    on these indicators for more than 500 Indian institutions, which have significant amount of research output during
                    the period.

                <p class="text-justify">
                    The portal does not, in any way, attempts to do any kind of research performance assessment or ranking of one or
                    more Indian institutions. Therefore, it should not be viewed as research performance assessment exercise, which
                    would require a lot of more data (such as number of researchers, research budget, research facilities etc.) and
                    several normalizations (such as publications per capita, output per unit of funding etc.). The portal can be best
                    viewed as an academic exercise to provide useful quantitative indicators & values of Indian scientific research,
                    both at the level of the country as well as at the level of individual institutions.
